In order to give users and developers greater flexibilty in their systems Funtoo
has introduced a new set of profiles. The main idea behind the Funtoo 1.0
profiles is to do away with the current monolithic "one size fit's all"
approach. Instead of setting one massive profile and then overriding whatever
you don't want, the Funtoo 1.0 Profile uses a new multi profile approach which
allows way more flexibility and customization.

In order to acheive this flexibility it was necessary to change the way profiles
are set from the previous /etc/make.profile symlink to using the
/etc/portage/make.profile/parent file. At this time there is not an automated
way of switching. Please go to http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/Funtoo_1.0_Profile for
instructions on how to switch.
